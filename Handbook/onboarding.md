## Initial Product Training

As part of the initial onboarding it is important to get at least a surface understanding of the product we're building. If you have not used the product before then it's also a very valuable testing opportunity to help us understand how intuitive the product is. Your comments are always greatly appreciated as we expect continuous improvement and for each team member to contribute to that whether by direct improvement, discovering problem areas, or improving documentation, design, or process.
