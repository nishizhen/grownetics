If the `home_screen` [feature flag](home-screen.md) is set to true,
on login, users will be redirected to `/pages/home` which contains 3 quick start buttons,
one for the Dashboard, one for Hardware, and one for Batches.

This allows users to get to the pages they need more quickly, for example on mobile
if they just need the Hardware page to quickly toggle an output, it doesn't make sense
to have them load the whole dashboard first.
