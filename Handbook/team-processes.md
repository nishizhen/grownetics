### Expensing Travel & Purchases

Any employee attempting to plan a trip or make a purchase using company assets must fill out a Budget Spreadsheet. The Budget Spreadsheet will have a form dedicated to planning company trips, but you are free to adapt the template to your needs. The template for the Budget Spreadsheet can be found within the company S.O.P. library.

### Hiring & Contracting

In order to protect our culture and quality of work Grownetics implements a hire slow policy. A typical hire will start with part time contract work for a 3 month trial period followed by an offer for the first year. 

### Trial Period

All positions in the company are contract to hire. Trial period starts at 3 months but can extend to 1 year for leadership positions. During the trial period there will be closer attention paid to contractors timeliness, ability to adopt Grownetics work methodology, cultural fit, and quality of work.

### Recruiting

Grownetics institutes a blind hiring process for full time staff. The standard blind process requires two people, one to manage the form and sheet (not related to the hire), and the person doing the hiring.
Overall stages as follows:
[~2hr] Review and define work to be done and ideal outcome
Define ideal candidates with 1st, 2nd, 3rd priority scoring key
