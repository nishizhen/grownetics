Contributing to Arduino JSON
============================

If you want to contribute to the project, please:

1. Use GitHub pull request feature
2. Follow the coding conventions
3. Write tests

About the coding conventions: I try to follow the [Google C++ Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html) with few variations to match the Arduino conventions.

I use [ClangFormat](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to format the code for me.
I use [CppLint](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cpplint/cpplint.py) to detect non-compliant stuff.

You should have a look at the `scripts/` folder as it contains a few helpers scripts.
