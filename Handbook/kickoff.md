# Project Kickoff and Delivery

At this point at least 50% balance payment has been made and the clock starts ticking to deliver on our 4-6 week lead time.

The project management requirements, documentation, and processes required to deliver are listed here on this page. Between this document, [Manufacturing](manufacturing.md), and [Installations](installations.md) there should a complete project delivery playbook.  

## Project Delivery Goals & Measurables

With every new project we're looking to improve our workflows and processes to continue to improve our delivery efficiency, quality, and service.

Between these three goals we can define several metrics to objectively measure our current status. 

**Efficiency** can be summed up into time/money

**Quality** can be tied to failure rate

**Service** can be tied to customer satisfaction and points of contact (fewer is better).

## Project Folders 

If the client has already made their minimum $10k deposit prior to kickoff their folder should already be under Google Drive/All Company/Client Projects. Otherwise move their folder from All Company/Leads to the Client Projects directory. 

Within the clients project folder there should be these folders (if not make them).  
+ Dashboard SVGs  
+ Integration Plans  
+ Contracts  
+ Sourcing & PO's
+ Manufacturing
+ Controls  
+ Archived  
+ Client Drawings  

## Project Planning in Wrike

The project schedule and tasks related to delivery are tracked in Wrike. In order to leverage the pre-defined delivery steps for a project go to the plus icon at the top of the page and click Request, choose 'New Production Run' and fill out the form. 

**MRP S.O. Number**: Use SO[DateOfDeposit] - Project Description. For example if the 50% deposit was made on Dec 10th, 2018. The SO number would be SO181210 - CFH R&D Greenhouse Project.

**Notes**: 
- Start date
- Controls Delivery Date
- Servers & Sensors Delivery Date
- Project Description, Unique Aspects

**Attach SO Form**: Attach the invoice and/or final integration plan with final agreed upon Hardware list.

**Enter Project Start Date**: Select the Date of Client Kickoff Meeting. 

After submitting this form Wrike will create the project boilerplate which should be a good starting point for the delivery schedule and plan. 

Move the newly created project into the clients folder and begin updating to reflect actual dates and expected durations.

Since wrike has the ability for tasks live in two places at once tasks that become active should be staged into the HW Sprint/Build Board.

## Production Planning in Airtable

We track inventory, facility data, manufacturing BOM's, sub-assemblies and suppliers all in Airtable. Sign in with your G-Suite account and you should be dropped see the Airtable 'bases' under the G-Team. 

### Creating the Master Project BOM

Duplicate the latest or most similar project BOM and begin populating with purchased items (including items we do not manufacture). The goal of this exercise is to come up with a master PO (purchase order) and a master MO (manufacturing order), each of these may be made up of sub-assembly PO's and MO's. 

Note: Be sure to add 10-20% more hardware into the purchase order for better price breaks and to have replacement stock on hand for previous clients.
