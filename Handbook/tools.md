#### Productivity Tips:
1. Write down actions for your tasks/to-do's. Do not write meaningless tasks like 'Needs' these should be NEXT ACTIONS, a better way to write it would be 'Setup discovery call/meeting with customer X'.
2. Write everything down and put in a system you trust whether pen and paper, wrike, workflowy. No one can carry everything in their head.
