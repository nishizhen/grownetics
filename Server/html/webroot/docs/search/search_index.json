You can add Plants to a Batch at anytime so it's good to create planned Harvest Batches (without plants, but with a Strain/Recipe) and add your Plants with their tags once they hit soil, then complete the Plant Batch task. Plants can be created in two ways: Plants can be created from a range using the last few digits of it's tag. Plant Groups (Batches) usually have tags in sequential order. The range below will create a Batch with 20 Plants with IDs as 1A400021266F0EE000000040, 1A400021266F0EE000000041, 1A400021266F0EE000000042, ... 1A400021266F0EE000000057, 1A400021266F0EE000000058, 1A400021266F0EE000000059.

A custom task has no restrictions for due date or Zone, you can even leave these blank.

A task should be completed on the same day that the Batch was Planted, Moved, or Harvested (most often after leaving Flower for the last time, or after Trim, once the batch has entered Dry).
