# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: growgrowgrow"
```

> Make sure to replace `growgrowgrow` with your API key.

Grownetics uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can request an API key at support@grownetics.co

Grownetics expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: growgrowgrow`

You must replace <code>growgrowgrow</code> with your personal API key.
