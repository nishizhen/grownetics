Click your Username in the top left of the menu to access your Account Settings page.

Half way down the Account Settings page there is a toggle that allows you to pick between Imperial and Metric. Click which one you prefer, hit save, navigate back to the Dashboard, and the units in your charts and maps will be in the units that you selected.
