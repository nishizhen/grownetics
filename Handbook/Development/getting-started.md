# Getting Started

To get started developing Grownetics locally, start with the [Developer Setup](/Development/how-we-develop/#developer-setup) section.

You can also reference the [Dev OSX](/Development/dev-osx/) page for common errors and problems.

Finally the [GrowServer](/Development/growserver/) page will help you navigate the code.

Join the chat room, ask questions, and help flesh this page out.
