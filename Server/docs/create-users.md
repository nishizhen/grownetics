Only users with a role of Owner or higher may add users.

Log in as an Owner user, or ask an Owner to do so. Under 'Settings' in the Navigation Menu there will be a 'Manage Users' link. Click this, then click 'Create User' at the bottom of the page.

Enter a name and email address for the new user, and hit Save. The user will receive an email with a link they can follow to set a password. Once their password is set they can login.

This user will by default be created with the 'User' role. To grant them higher permissions, edit the user, select a new Role, and hit Save
