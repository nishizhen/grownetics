Ordering process from MacroFAB

In upverter, export the XYRS, the Gerber files, and the NC Drill files.

Open the exported CSV and replace the commas with tabs.

Rename the CSV to have `.XYRS` at the end of the filename.

Note: Be carefule here on macs, as they can add a hidden extension to the end so you can end up with .csv.XYRS.csv Check in a terminal to be sure.

Upload the .XYRS, the Gerber .zip file, and the NC Drill file to MacroFab.

Delete the unassigned layer.

Go the the Bill of Materials tab and assign all the parts a part number from the Macrofab catalog.

Go to the Part Placement tab and nudge the parts into place.

That's it. Order away.
