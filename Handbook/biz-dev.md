#### How to pick a logo

+ Primary logo is always the green one with the icon above the logotype, only use alternatives when absolutely necessary.  
+ Always pick the highest resolution logo possible, and ensure there is enough white space around wherever it is placed. Refer to style guide if unsure how to use the logo.  
+ Use .png when transparent background is needed  
+ Horizontal logo is for just that  
+ Use icon with different backgrounds with discretion, when in doubt reference whats been done.

tl;dr - 5% commission for 1st year maximum $50,000 per deal. Usually use Mutual NDA, sometimes unilateral NDA is fine but be sure to know why you're using either one.

## Lead Development

## Sales Process

Generally speaking the most important thing to remember is sales is to build rapport. We sell a premium product for enterprise cultivations and will only buy if there's a strong bond of trust built. Sales at this level are always personal. Do not be afraid to just pick up the phone and call the lead, do not hard sell, just catch up on a personal level and see if there's anything yuo can do to help.

1. Personalized intro email to schedule a video screen share demo
2. Discuss client goals and relate to our capabilities, demo walkthrough via screen share.
3. Setup client demo sandbox if needed
4. Receive Floor Plans
5. Prep Integration Plans based on client goals (with quote)
6. Review Integration Plan with client (either live or after Integration Plan is sent)
7. Update Integration Plan if required
8. Send final quote, Master Terms of Service and Statement of Work (SOW) for signature
9. 10-20k lock in deposit (% of deal size)

5. Rename protogrow to client name.

#### 2. Modify Integration Plan
