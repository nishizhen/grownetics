# 3D Printing

We use the Flash Forge Creator Pro to print our enclosures. These affordable dual head 3D printers are exceptionally high quality but still require some nuance and maintenance to keep running smooth. 

## Filaments

We use Hatchbox brand ABS plastic (1.75mm) primary colors we use are white or green.

## Working with 3D Models

We use Fusion 360 for our enclosure modeling, right click on the body you want to print and click export as stl file. 

## Preparing the 3D Print Files

We use Simplify 3D for preparing the code that runs the 3D printer (.x3g files, not gcode for these machines). If you have an existing .x3g file you can just copy to an SD card plug into a printer and hit print. If you're starting from scratch ask Vince for tips.

## Running Production Prints

Production Plates have the maximum number of enclosures that will fit on the print plater. 

## Removing Prints when Done

## Interrupting Prints

## Changing Filament Tips

Whether changing filament or starting up the machines after they've been off for a while run the load filament program, it will heat and push filament down, reveal any existing clogs and help prevent breakage when removing the filament in the nozzle. After a few inches of filament have been extruded run the remove filament program and help gently guide it out. Swap out the roll of filament carefully, do not let the new roll tangle or unfurl, you want to keep the tension from the new roll when you feed it into the filament feed tube. Make sure rotation matches feed tube location.

## Printer Maintenance

Clogs will happen, learn to disassemble the print heads via YouTube and watch before attempting.
