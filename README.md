# Grownetics

Welcome to Grownetics Open Source repository.

Grownetics is a platform to help the world learn how to grow every plant better.

This repository will contain as much as we can possibly open source.

## Repository Status

Until recently all of our source was closed. We are moving to open
as much of it as we can. As we do that, there will be problems, bugs,
etc. This repository can be considered unstable.
