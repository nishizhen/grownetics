# How to Hold a Productive Meeting

We try to systematize our weekly team meetings to allow everyone to schedule their work and focus during the week. Interruptions when you're focused on deep work are one of the most frustrating aspects of living in this connected world. To combat this we have developed a remote first and asynchronous work culture (see how-we-work.md on more about this). If you need to focus during the day let the team know in your standup no interruptions plz. Set your chat profile to do-not-disturb or away.

So you've run into an issue and you dont think you can move forward. Now you might think you need to call a meeting, but wait, review this handy 'Should I hold a meeting' infographic and then proceed.

Okay, so now you're either back at work or still stuck. In the case of still being stuck and you've exhausted your quick wins, get in touch with someone who can remove your blocker, if it's urgent CALL! If it's not as much put it in chat or propose a meeting date with the team members you'd like input from.

In preparation for the meeting make sure there is an agenda outlined in a fresh Meeting Doc Template placed in the correct Meetings folder. (Template docs are in All Company). Prep the doc and put the link in the google calendar events description then invite others.

During the meeting when one person is talking the other should be documenting what is being discussed. Prior to saying something type your topic/ question /idea so we end with an accurate record of what was discussed and their next actions.
